# mcgTrace
A ray tracer based on the automated tests specifications on The Ray Tracer Challenge book, by @jamis

## The book
Jamis Buck is (as of November 2018) writing a book published by Pragmatic Programmers that describes how to implement a Ray Tracer step by step.

Jamis does this in a language agnostic form by means of Cucumber tests scenarios anyone can implement using the language they want.

## The project
Well, as a passionate for programming and computer graphics alike, sure I found this a great opportunity to practice TDD and Python at first. Maybe later I should try other languages and paradigms too, like Elixir and functional programming.

So this is my approach to implementing a ray tracer in Python using TDD.

## Contributing to the project
As this is a learning/practicing project I'd love to see some opinions, suggestions, tips and tricks about the code, tests and the project structure. Feel free to open an issue so we can discuss better!

Thank you for reading this and the code, of course!
